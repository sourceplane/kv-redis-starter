# TIER 2 — the product a bootstrap produces builds, deploys (dry) and serves.
#
# placement.test.sh proves the tree a bootstrap ends with is the right tree.
# This proves it WORKS, by doing to it what its own pipelines will:
#
#   1. at the 01-product landing (the commit its one pull request merges),
#      run what `checks.yml` runs on that PR — install with the lockfile the
#      phase confirmed, render the wrangler fixture and check the committed
#      config IS that render, typecheck, lint, test, build. The landing WAITS
#      on those checks, so a product they refuse is a bootstrap that never
#      merges;
#   2. the stage lane's own steps, rendered by `orun plan` in the product for
#      a pull request (the verify profile: the deploy profile has no dry run)
#      — `verify-app-structure` (which checks the wrangler config exists
#      BEFORE anything is built), `build-app` (the component's buildCommand:
#      the live wiring render, then the build), `verify-build-output` and
#      `deploy-dry-run` (`wrangler deploy --dry-run --name <reponame>-web-stage`).
#      They run IN THE TREE THE RUNNER STAGES for the job
#      (testing/lib/stage-job.py), with the dependency layout the pinned
#      composition produces, and with the stage wiring document in the job's
#      environment as the platform resolves it (the component's secretEnv) —
#      so the namespace id in the built config is asserted to be the
#      document's, not the fixture's;
#   3. serve the built Worker with `wrangler dev` and run the component's OWN
#      `smokeCommand` against it, verbatim — the check the real deploy ends
#      with — and then read every route the page promises: the heading and
#      title carry the product's name, the links its repository, the Open
#      Graph image is absolute on the origin it was asked on, the static
#      assets are served, an unknown path is a 404 — and the count, which
#      only the Worker answers, goes up by exactly one per request (its KV
#      binding read and written; wrangler dev provides the namespace locally).
#
# What it cannot do is the platform's half: create the repository, mint the
# brokered Cloudflare token, apply the namespace, deploy for real and probe
# workers.dev. The KV root is verified to `terraform validate` (KR2) and its
# plan is part of every pull request's lanes; the apply needs an account.
#
# Needs: orun, node, pnpm, python3 (+PyYAML), git, curl, and the network for
# `pnpm install` and the build's Google Font (or a warm store). A few minutes:
# two installs and builds.
